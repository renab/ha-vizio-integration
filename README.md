### Remote Entity

This integration also implements the official Home Assistant VIZIO integration's Remote entity capabilities. Each configured VIZIO device exposes a `remote` entity that can:

- Turn the device on and off
- Send supported VIZIO remote key commands
- Repeat commands with Home Assistant's standard `num_repeats` and `delay_secs` options

Example remote command:

```yaml
service: remote.send_command
target:
  entity_id: remote.vizio_tv_remote
data:
  command:
    - MENU
    - OK
```

### Voice Commands

You can use voice commands with Home Assistant:

- "Turn on [VIZIO Device Name]"
- "Turn off [VIZIO Device Name]"
- "Volume up on [VIZIO Device Name]"
- "Volume down on [VIZIO Device Name]"
- "Set volume to 50 on [VIZIO Device Name]"
- "Mute [VIZIO Device Name]"
- "Change input source to [Source Name] on [VIZIO Device Name]"

### Service: `vizio_smartcast.update_setting`

Update a device setting directly.

**Service Data:**

```yaml
entity_id: media_player.vizio_tv
setting_type: audio
setting_name: volume
new_value: 50
```

**Parameters:**

### Automation Examples

      - service: media_player.turn_on
        target:
